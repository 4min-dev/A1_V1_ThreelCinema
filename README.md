Hey there! My project, ThreelessCinema, is a simple yet stylish project developed by me using various technologies to create a visually appealing interface and convenient functionality.

• React Router: A routing library facilitating navigation and transitions between pages within the application.

• API: Utilization of an external API (TMDB API) for fetching data about movies and other content.

• Git: Version control system facilitating collaborative work and code management for the project.

• Markdown: A markup language for creating readable and convenient documentation.

• GSAP: An animation library providing beautiful and smooth animations within the application interface.
